## Welcome to the repository for my personal blog project ðŸ˜„

It is built on Gatsby which is blazingly fast at rendering static html-pages. 
Maybe that is why i got interested in trying it out in the first place. Also, i get to write my content in markdown.

My goal for this project is to become a better writer and to share my experiences working as a fullstack developer in OsloðŸ‡³ðŸ‡´

If you have any suggestions to how i can make this blog even better for readers, 
feel free to file an issue [here](https://github.com/JonasJore/personal-blog/issues).
